## Data Structure

Reports are stored with the following schema:

```typescript
interface Report {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  content: string;
  goal?: string;
  prSummary?: {
    total: number;
    awaitingReview: number;
    recentPRs: Array<{
      id: number;
      title: string;
      url: string;
      author: string;
      createdAt: string;
    }>;
  };
  nextIssues?: Array<{
    type: 'existing' | 'idea';
    title: string;
    description: string;
    priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    url?: string;
  }>;
  userId: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## Implementation Notes

### Mock Data
The current implementation uses mock data for development and testing. In production, reports would be:
- Stored in a PostgreSQL database using Drizzle ORM
- Associated with authenticated users
- Integrated with GitHub API for real PR data

### Authentication
All report operations require user authentication. Users can only:
- View their own reports
- Create reports associated with their account
- Edit and delete reports they created

### GitHub Integration
Future enhancements will include:
- Automatic PR data fetching from GitHub API
- Integration with GitHub issues for next steps
- Repository-specific report filtering
- Automated report generation based on GitHub activity

## Best Practices

### Report Writing
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Include specific metrics and numbers
- Focus on actionable next steps
- Balance achievements with challenges
- Set realistic, measurable goals

### Frequency
- Weekly reports for active projects
- Sprint retrospectives for agile teams
- Monthly summaries for longer-term projects
- Milestone reports for major releases

### Collaboration
- Share reports with team members
- Use consistent formatting across teams
- Link to relevant GitHub issues and PRs
- Include context for external stakeholders

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Report Templates**: Pre-defined formats for common report types
- **Automated PR Integration**: Real-time GitHub data synchronization
- **Team Reports**: Collaborative reports across multiple users
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Trends and insights across multiple reports
- **Export Options**: PDF and Markdown export functionality
- **Notification System**: Reminders for regular report creation
- **GitHub Issue Integration**: Direct creation of issues from next steps

### API Integration
- GitHub API for PR and issue data
- Slack integration for report sharing
- Calendar integration for scheduled reports
- Email notifications for report updates
