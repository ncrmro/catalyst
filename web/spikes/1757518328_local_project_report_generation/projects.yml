          # Catalyst


          A development platform designed to help you ship faster. Provides
          opinionated deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and boilerplates. Simply
          connect your Git repositories and we handle the rest.


          Built on open standards, allowing you to deploy anywhere. Designed for
          agentic workflows.


          Available as a managed platform or self-hosted solution.


          # How Catalyst Helps


          - An agent or user works on a new feature and opens a pull request.

          - A preview environment is created for that agent.

          - CI is built and ran in the same environment as the preview
          environment keeping things fast.

          - Both agents (via MCP server) and users can inspect all internal
          services and public URLs of a service.

          This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

          ## Getting Started

          First, run the development server:

          ```bash
          npm run dev
          # or
          yarn dev
          # or
          pnpm dev
          # or
          bun dev
          ```

          Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

          You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


          ## What is Meze

          Meze is a comprehensive meal prepping platform that makes nutrition and meal planning effortless, leading to healthier living, better aesthetics, and often reduced food costs. We solve the complexity of nutrition science, meal planning, cooking coordination, and grocery shopping by providing an integrated solution that guides users through the entire meal prep lifecycle.

          ### The Problem We Solve

          - **Nutrition is complex**: Understanding macronutrients, micronutrients, and personal dietary needs
          - **Meal planning is overwhelming**: Deciding what to eat, when, and how much
          - **Shopping is inefficient**: Creating lists, finding ingredients, managing costs
          - **Cooking coordination is chaotic**: Especially for households with multiple people
          - **Food waste is costly**: Poor planning leads to expired ingredients and wasted money

          ### Our Solution: The Complete Meze Flow

          Meze streamlines the entire meal prep process through six integrated phases:

          #### 1. **PLAN** 📋
          **Data Models**: `users`, `households`, `meals`, `nutrients`, `users_nutrient_targets`

          - Set personalized nutrition goals based on user profiles and health objectives
          - Create meal plans that align with household preferences and dietary restrictions
          - Generate balanced meal combinations that meet individual macro/micronutrient targets
          - Schedule meal preps by date for household coordination
          - Account for household member preferences and dietary restrictions

          #### 2. **ORDER GROCERIES** 🛒
          **Data Models**: `grocery_orders`, `grocery_orders_ingredients`, `foods`

          - Automatically generate smart grocery lists based on planned meals
          - Calculate exact quantities needed to minimize food waste
          - **Future Feature**: Integrate with grocery store APIs to:
            - Place orders directly through partner stores
            - Compare prices across multiple retailers
            - Schedule pickup/delivery times
            - Track order status and substitutions

          #### 3. **PREP** 🔪
          **Data Models**: `meals_preps`, `households`, `foods`

          - Receive step-by-step prep instructions optimized for efficiency
          - Coordinate prep tasks among household members
          - Batch similar preparation steps across multiple meals
          - Track prep progress and completion status
          - Provide prep time estimates and scheduling recommendations

          #### 4. **COOK** 👨‍🍳
          - Access cooking instructions with precise timing and techniques
          - Coordinate cooking schedules for multiple meals
          - Provide equipment and cookware recommendations
          - Offer cooking tips and technique guides
          - Support various cooking methods (meal prep containers, fresh cooking, etc.)

          #### 5. **STORE** 📦
          - Provide optimal food storage guidelines for maximum freshness
          - Label and organize prepared meals by date and contents
          - Track expiration dates and consumption schedules
          - Optimize refrigerator and freezer space utilization
          - Send reminders for meal consumption timing

          #### 6. **CLEAN** 🧽
          - Generate efficient cleanup checklists
          - Coordinate cleanup tasks among household members
          - Provide tips for maintaining clean prep spaces
          - Track kitchen inventory and supply needs
          - Schedule regular deep cleaning and maintenance

          ### Key Features

          **For Individuals:**
          - Personalized nutrition tracking with macro/micronutrient goals
          - Custom meal plans based on preferences and restrictions

          ### Technology Stack

          - **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS
          - **Backend**: Next.js API routes with server actions
          - **Database**: SQLite with Drizzle ORM
          - **APIs**: RESTful APIs including markdown generation endpoints
          - **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages with OpenNext
          - **Data**: Structured JSON models for MVP, scalable to full database

          ### Current Status

          Currently in MVP development phase with:
          - ✅ Core data models defined
          - ✅ Basic Next.js application structure
          - 🚧 User interface development
          - 🚧 Meal planning algorithms
          - 🚧 Grocery list generation
          - 📋 Grocery store API integrations (planned)

          ## Testing

          Meze uses a comprehensive three-tier testing approach:

          ### Test Structure
          - **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual functions and utilities using Jest
          - **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test interactions between components, actions, and data layers using Jest
          - **End-to-End Tests** (`tests/e2e/`): Test complete user workflows using Playwright

          ### Running Tests
          ```bash
          # Run all tests
          npm test

          # Run specific test types
          npm run test:unit        # Unit tests only
          npm run test:integration # Integration tests only
          npm run test:e2e         # E2E tests only

          # Run CI pipeline (linting + all tests)
          make ci
          ```

          See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for detailed testing documentation.

          ## Getting Started with Development

          First, run the development server:

          ```bash
          npm run db:migrate
          npm run dev
          ```

          Alternatively, you can use Docker Compose for development:

          ```bash
          # Start all services in detached mode, run migrations, and follow logs
          make up

          # Stop all services
          make down

          # Clean all services and delete database files
          make destroy
          ```

          ### Database Migration Management

          When working with database migrations on different branches, you may encounter conflicts. To resolve these:

          ```bash
          # Reset drizzle folder from main branch and regenerate migrations
          make migration-reconcile
          ```

          This command can be used to:
          - Regenerate migrations after rebasing on a branch with migration conflicts
          - Consolidate multiple migrations on a feature branch before committing and merging
          - Clean up migration files to ensure consistency before creating a pull request

          Meze transforms the overwhelming process of healthy eating into a simple, automated system that anyone can follow, making nutritious meal prepping accessible to busy individuals and families alike.
