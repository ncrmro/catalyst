  - Encourage the team to prioritize open issues based on urgency and impact, particularly those linked to the milestones.
  - Engage the community for contributions to increase the number of stars and forks, indicating broader interest and usage.

## Next Steps
  - Focus on closing at least 2-3 of the long-standing open issues within the next sprint.
  - Schedule a review session for all draft PRs to expedite their readiness for merging.
  - Continue to document processes and feature implementations to improve onboarding and clarity for contributors.
