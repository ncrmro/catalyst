# Agent Development Guidelines

When developing components, always create or re-export generic components from `src/components/ui`.
Avoid importing components directly from `tetrastack-react-glass-components` elsewhere in the application to ensure consistent styling and maintainability.

## Commit Guidelines

Always use semantic commits. If available, include the spec, issue, or pull request number as part of the commit subject.
