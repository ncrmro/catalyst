# Catalyst

A development platform designed to help you ship faster. Provides opinionated deployments, CI/CD pipelines, and boilerplates. Simply connect your Git repositories and we handle the rest.

Built on open standards, allowing you to deploy anywhere. Designed for agentic workflows.

Available as a managed platform or self-hosted solution.

# How Catalyst Helps

- An agent or user works on a new feature and opens a pull request.
- A preview environment is created for that agent.
- CI is built and ran in the same environment as the preview environment keeping things fast.
- Both agents (via MCP server) and users can inspect all internal services and public URLs of a service.
