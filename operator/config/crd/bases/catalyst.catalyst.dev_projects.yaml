                                        If ReadOnly is false, this field has no meaning and must be unspecified.

                                        If ReadOnly is true, and this field is set to Disabled, the mount is not made
                                        recursively read-only.  If this field is set to IfPossible, the mount is made

                                        field is set to Enabled, the mount is made recursively read-only if it is
                                        supported by the container runtime, otherwise the pod will not be started and
                                        an error will be generated to indicate the reason.

                                        None (or be unspecified, which defaults to None).

                                        If this field is not specified, it is treated as an equivalent of Disabled.

                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                      core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                      When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                      the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                      provisioner.
                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                        specified.
                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                        in any namespaces.
                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      VolumeAttributesClass will be applied to the claim. If the claim enters an Infeasible error state,
                                      this field can be reset to its previous value (including nil) to cancel the modification.
                                      If the resource referred to by volumeAttributesClass does not exist, this PersistentVolumeClaim will be
                                      set to a Pending state, as reflected by the modifyVolumeStatus field, until such as a resource
                                      exists.
